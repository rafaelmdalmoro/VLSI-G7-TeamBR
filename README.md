# VLSI-G7-TeamBR
Final Project and Lab Exercises from VLSI Design 

## Lab 2
1. Design a an 16-bit running light in VHDL and implement it on your Nexys A7 FPGA board. The running light model should have the following inputs and outputs (Clock,Reset, Enable).
2. Design a 1-digit counter on your FPGA board. Use the 7-segment display to display the outputs and push buttons to realize your inputs (Clock,Reset, Enable, UpDown).

The exercise files are available [here](https://github.com/rafaelmdalmoro/VLSI-G7-TeamBR/tree/main/Lab02)

## Lab 3
1. Extend the VHDL code of Lab2 Ex 2 to realize a 2 digit Counter.
2. Based on Exercise 1 a stopwatch should be designed on the Nexys FPGA board using the available 7 segment displays.

The exercise files are available [here](https://github.com/rafaelmdalmoro/VLSI-G7-TeamBR/tree/main/Lab03)

## Lab 4
1. Create an 1 bit adder.
2. Use the 1 bit adder previously created to make an IP for a simple 4 bit Adder.

The exercise files are available [here](https://github.com/rafaelmdalmoro/VLSI-G7-TeamBR/tree/main/Lab04)

## Lab 5
1. Create a block design including Microblaze and synthesize the VHDL code based on that
2. Export it to Vitis and run the C code

## Project
The idea of the project is to implement a simplified version of the video game known as "Guitar Hero" in the FPGA. Our version implemented in the FPGA uses the 7-segment displays of the development board as the screen, with segments representing the notes moving through the tracks. The board's LEDs indicate the current streak of the player. The push buttons represent the player's controller. The sound of each note is played through the Mono Audio jack on the board. This version only contais the song "Asa branca" from the singer Luiz Gonzaga.

The project files, including the documentation are available [here](https://github.com/rafaelmdalmoro/VLSI-G7-TeamBR/tree/main/Project)

## Backup
This folder was used, as the name sugests, as a backup and to pass the code between the members of the group, so everyone could work on the code.

The whole code of each exercise as well as the code for the project is available [here](https://github.com/rafaelmdalmoro/VLSI-G7-TeamBR/tree/main/Backup)
