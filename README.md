# VLSI-G7-TeamBR
Final Project and Lab Exercises from VLSI Design 

## Project 2
1. Design a an 16-bit running light in VHDL and implement it on your Nexys A7 FPGA board. The running light model should have the following inputs and outputs (Clock,Reset, Enable)
2. Design a 1-digit counter on your FPGA board. Use the 7-segment display to display the outputs and push buttons to realize your inputs (Clock,Reset, Enable, UpDown)

## Project 3
1. Extend the VHDL code of
